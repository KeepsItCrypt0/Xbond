# xBOND Protocol
 
This readme provides a comprehensive overview of the xBOND protocol, its mechanics, and why it offers value to holders.



The protocol aims to create sustainable value for token holders by:

• Facilitating liquidity provision to a Pulsex liquidity pool (xBOND/PLSX pair).

• Implementing a tax mechanism on transfers to enhance reserves and reward holders.

• Periodically withdrawing lp tokens and reinvesting back into plsx reserves.

• Allowing users to redeem xbond for underlying PLSX tokens.



# Core Features

• Token Issuance: Mint xBOND by depositing PLSX during a 90-day period.

• Liquidity Pool: Fees from deposits fund a xBOND/PLSX pool on PulseX.

• Transfer Tax: 5% tax on xBOND transfers. (5% to PLSTR, 20% burned, and 75% to PLSX an reinvested into reserves)

• Redemption: Redeem xBOND for proportional amount of PLSX in contract balance.

• Liquidity Reinvestment: public function allows Withdraw and reinvestment of 12.5% of LP tokens every 90 days.



# Why Invest in xBOND?



Passive Value Growth:

• The 5% transfer tax ensures continuous accumulation of PLSX in the contract and deflation of xbond, increasing the backing value of each XBOND.

• liquidity withdrawal and reinvestment every 90 days optimize the contract's PLSX holdings, enhancing redeemable value.


Deflationary Mechanics:

• Share redemption burns xBOND tokens, reducing total supply and potentially Increasing the value of remaining tokens.

• Lower supply, combined with growing PLSX reserves, can enhance the per-share backing ratio.

• 20% of the transfer tax is burned making xbond deflationary.


 
Accessible Entry and Exit:

• Users can issuethemselves xbond during the 90-day issuance period with a reasonable minimum deposit (10 PLSX).

• A liquidity pool is created by contract that allows for user's to take advantage of discounts or premiums.

• Redemption is available anytime,
providing flexibility to exit with PLSX proportional to the contract's balance.

• Transparent operations via event logs and view functions build trust and engagement.



# Why xBOND Earns Value for Holders


Transfer Tax Redistribution:

• Every XBOND transfer incurs 5% tax, of which 75% is swapped for PLSX and held by the contract's reserves.

• This increases the contract's PLSX balance, directly boosting the redeemable value per xBOND share

• 20% of the transfer tax is burned making xbond deflationary and increases the plsx per xbond ratio.


Liquidity Withdrawal and Reinvestment:

• Every 90 days, 12.5% of LP tokens are withdrawn, yielding xBOND and PLSX.

• Withdrawn xBOND is swapped for PLSX, consolidating the contract's holdings into PLSX.

• This reinvestment increases the PLSX backing ratio, enhancing the value users can redeem per xbond.



The xBOND protocol offers a compelling DeFi investment opportunity by combining liquidity provision, tax redistribution, burns, and periodic reinvestment to create value for holders. 

Its transparent mechanics, secure design,and integration with PulseX make it an attractive option for both new and seasoned DeFi participants.

By holding xBOND, users can benefit from passive PLSX accumulation, deflationary tokenomics, and a growing liquidity pool, all while retaining the flexibility to redeem shares at any time.
